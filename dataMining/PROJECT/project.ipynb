    "# Data Mining final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project you are going to work in groups of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "The aim of this project is to predict molecular properties.  You are going to work with molecular data and you have  to predict 4 molecular properties,  the Octanol-water partition coefficient (logP),  the number of rotatable bonds (RBN),  the molecular weight (MW) and the number of the rings (RN).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to work using a subset the QM9 dataset.  The original QM9 dataset [Ramakrishnan et al.,2014)](ttps://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422), contains $134k $ stable small organic molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data  consists of the following files:\n",
    "1. QM9.txt\n",
    "2. properties_QM9.npz\n",
    "\n",
    "In **QM9.txt** the molecules are represented as SMILES  (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system).  SMILES strings proposed by Weininger (1988),  are non-unique representations which encode the molecular graph into a sequence of ASCII characters using a depth-first graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we ask you to predict 4 molecular properties,  the Octanol-water partition coefficient (logP),  the  number of rotatable bonds (RBN),  the molecular weight (MW) and the number of the rings (RN).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- logP: represents a measure of the tendency of a compound to move from the aqueous phase into lipids\n",
    "- Number of rotatable bonds (RBN):  the number of bonds which allow free rotation around themselves \n",
    "- Molecular weight (MW): the weight of a molecule based on the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule\n",
    "- Number of the rings (RN): the number of connected sets of atoms and bonds in which every atom and bond is a member of a cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "**properties\\_QM9.npz** file contains these 4 properties for the QM9.txt data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "Before starting your analysis it is very important to understand the data and the objective of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to chose the representation of the data that you are going to use. If you want to work with one-hot-encoding data (see project.pdf for details) you can find the code to convert a single smile string to a one-hot encoding in `smile_to_hot()` function at `utils.py`.\n",
    " You can even use as input data different properties and descriptors (number of bonds,  number of atoms,  number of C, number of O e.t.c. )  that you can extract from your data  manually or using RDKit.  (The properties that we mention are random examples,  there are much more properties and descriptors for the molecules and you have to think what it makes sense for you to use). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to try different approaches and models,  you can use ready libraries for your algorithm. The main focus is to see the model you have come up but also the other approaches that you tried. You have to understand deeply all the algorithms that you have tried. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using load\\_data() function in utils.py split the data and the corresponding properties  into train and test.  Use **cross-validation** to select the best model based on **statistical significant test**.  Only for the best model you will use the test data (of course you have to include in your report and present all the models that you have tried).   **It is mandatory to use three or more different algorithms in addition to a baseline**. \n",
    "\n",
    "(The baseline is the naive baseline algorithm,  providing context on just how good a given method actually is.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model we would expect is a model that can work on universal data,  which means it can give a reasonable prediction on different molecular datasets.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report\n",
    "You have to submit a formal report .  Your report has to include the approaches that you followed and main results not only for your final model but for all the models you have tried. We want a full picture of what exactly you have done and how. You should also discuss the different performances you have with your methods and explain why these work or not. What is important is to show us that you have a good understanding of the problem and of how to model it, what are the problems you encountered and how you solved them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is an open project, you can try many different approaches as long as they make sense to get the best performance (creative ideas are always welcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final submission\n",
    "For your final submission you have to submit on Moodle a folder named using your names (ex. NAME1_NAME2_DM_project) which should include your code (all the scripts), the dataset and your report (the report should also be saved using your names: NAME1_NAME2_DM_project.pdf).  If the size of your submission is big you can upload your submission on [SWITCH drive](https://www.switch.ch) and put on Moodle the shared link. "

We can then setup the particular environment  using the [Conda yml file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) I put in the folder of the project.\n",

Ring structures are written by breaking each ring at an arbitrary point (although some choices will lead to a more legible SMILES than others) to make a 'straight non-ring' structure (as if it wasn't a ring) and adding numerical ring closure labels to show connectivity between non-adjacent atoms. Aromacity is commonly illustrated by writing the constituent B, C, N, O, P and S atoms in lower-case forms b, c, n, o, p and s, respectively.\n",
